# WWDC-Scholarship-2017
This is a program that I built as a submission for scholarship to WWDC 2017. It is made for Swift playgrounds and optimized for a device being held vertically, such as an iPhone.
 
Though it is simple, it represents the many challenges that face people in life. The square represents a person who has a lot of potential to be successful in life, and the rectangles represent obstacles in the person's life. It may seem like it may take a long time to overcome all of the obstacles -- it may even look like it will not happen at all -- but in the end, all obstacles are overcome, and it is a satisfying achievement.
 
I relate this to my strive to get a scholarship for WWDC - hopefully the all of the struggle will be worth it.
 
Thanks for reading! If you are here for the code, I made it open source and left comments through it so that anyone can learn from it. It's all written in Swift 3.1 and designed for Swift Playgrounds for Mac or iPad. Enjoy!
